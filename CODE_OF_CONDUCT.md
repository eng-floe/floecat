# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

This project is committed to fostering an open, respectful, and technically productive community. Our goal is to create an environment where contributors can collaborate effectively on shared engineering problems, exchange ideas freely, and improve the software together.

Participation in this project, which includes code contributions, issues, discussions, reviews, and community spaces, requires adherence to this Code of Conduct.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including:

- GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and discussions
- Project documentation and communication channels
- Community interactions representing the project in public forums

It applies to all participants, including maintainers, contributors, and observers.

---

## Expected Behavior

Participants are expected to:

- Be respectful and professional in technical discussions.
- Focus criticism on ideas, code, and design decisions — not individuals.
- Assume good faith when interacting with others.
- Provide constructive feedback grounded in technical reasoning.
- Accept that disagreement is normal in engineering collaboration.
- Respect differing levels of experience and background.
- Help maintain a welcoming environment for contributors of all skill levels.

Examples of constructive participation include:

- Providing actionable review feedback.
- Asking clarifying questions before making assumptions.
- Supporting claims with evidence, benchmarks, or documentation.
- Acknowledging uncertainty or tradeoffs in technical debates.

---

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not permitted:

- Personal attacks, insults, or derogatory comments.
- Harassment, intimidation, or sustained disruption of discussions.
- Trolling, baiting, or intentionally inflammatory behavior.
- Dismissive or hostile responses that discourage participation.
- Publishing private information without consent.
- Repeatedly ignoring project guidelines or maintainer direction.

Technical disagreement alone is **not** a violation. However, hostility or personal escalation during disagreement is.

---

## Technical Discussion Norms

This is an engineering-focused project. Strong opinions and rigorous debate are expected, but must remain professional.

When disagreements occur:

- Prefer evidence over rhetoric.
- Prefer clarity over volume.
- Prefer collaboration over winning arguments.

Maintainers may redirect discussions that become unproductive or off-topic.

---

## Maintainer Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for:

- Enforcing this Code of Conduct consistently and fairly.
- Setting the tone for professional collaboration.
- Guiding discussions toward productive technical outcomes.
- Making final decisions when consensus cannot be reached.

Maintainers may moderate, edit, lock, or remove content that violates this Code of Conduct.

---

## Enforcement

If behavior violates this Code of Conduct, maintainers may take actions including:

- Requesting behavior changes
- Issuing warnings
- Removing comments or contributions
- Temporarily or permanently restricting participation

Enforcement decisions are made at the discretion of the maintainers and are not subject to public debate.

---

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or observe behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it by contacting the maintainers:

**Contact:** [floecat-maintainers@floedb.ai](mailto:floecat-maintainers@floedb.ai)

Reports will be handled confidentially to the extent possible.

---

## Good Faith Clause

Open source collaboration involves people from different cultures, communication styles, and levels of English proficiency. Misunderstandings happen.

Participants are encouraged to:

- Seek clarification before escalation.
- Allow room for correction and learning.
- Extend reasonable goodwill when intent is unclear.

---

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by established open-source community standards, including the Contributor Covenant, and adapted for an engineering-focused technical project.

---

This project follows a Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this standard.
